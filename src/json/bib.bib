  abstract={We propose an enantioselective scheme to sort homogeneous chiral particles using optical tweezers. For a certain range of material parameters, we show that a highly focused circularly-polarized laser beam traps particles of a specific chirality selected by the handedness of the trapping beam. Furthermore, by applying a transverse Stokes drag force that displaces the trapped particle off-axis, we allow for the rotation of the particle center-of-mass around the trapping beam axis. The rotation angle is highly dependent on the handedness of the trapped particle and is easily measurable with standard video-microscopy techniques, allowing for an alternative mechanism for chiral resolution. Our platform not only allows for enantioselection of particles dispersed in solution but also paves the way to the characterization of the chiral parameter of individual, homogeneous chiral microspheres using optical tweezing.}

abstract={In this work we study the influence of considering partial sets of earthquakes data has on the temporal and spatial probability distributions of earthquakes, using data from the California region between 2003 and 2016, with different thresholds for magnitude and depth of hypocenters. For this we have considered sequences of earthquakes where we have ``jump'', or pulled, a given fixed number of actually sequential earthquakes. Through the concepts of Non-Extensive Statistical Mechanics for the time interval between earthquakes, we have found that the increase of the jump between earthquakes forming the sequence, affects the non-extensive characteristic of the system in the temporal probability distribution, denoted by a change in the value of the entropic index q, for relatively small jump sizes. However, for the distance between earthquakes, we observe that the increase of jumps lets untouched the non-extensive characteristic of the system, keeping the entropic index values q approximately constant. This analysis allows not just to show the robustness of the Non-Extensive Statistical Mechanics treatments for the study of earthquakes, but also their limits of applicability with respect to jumps or data loss. At the same time, it is a very useful test for memory effects and long-range interactions.},

This work is an extension of a previous study using a similar approach, for shallow events. We have addressed the problem under the perspective of complex networks, using a time window model to build the networks for deep earthquakes. These networks present scale-free and small-world features, contributing to strengthen the use of the time window model to construct epicenters networks. The results for deep events were analyzed using Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics and they corroborate with those found for the shallow ones, since the connectivity distribution for deep earthquakes also follows a q-exponential distribution and the scaling behavior is present. Our findings reinforce the idea of long-range correlations between earthquakes and the criticality of the seismological system.},

abstract={In this work, we introduce a new methodology to construct a network of epicenters that avoids problems found in well-established methodologies when they are applied to global catalogs of earthquakes located in shallow zones. The new methodology involves essentially the introduction of a time window which works as a temporal filter. Our approach is more generic and for small regions the results coincide with previous findings. The network constructed with that model has small-world properties and the distribution of node connectivity follows a non-traditional function, namely a q-exponential, where scale-free properties are present. The vertices with larger connectivity in the network correspond to the areas with very intense seismic activities in the period considered. These new results strengthen the hypothesis of long spatial and temporal correlations between earthquakes.},

In addition, we also have characterized the influence that the probability p produces in certain characteristics of the lattice and in the intensity of border effects. From the two topologies, networks of consecutive epicenters were constructed, that allowed us to analyze the distribution of connectivities of each one. In our results distributions arise belonging to a family of non-traditional distributions functions, which agrees with previous studies using data from actual earthquakes. Our results reinforce the idea that the Earth is in a critical self-organized state and furthermore point towards temporal and spatial correlations between earthquakes in different places.},

abstract={This paper presents an analysis of the distribution of periods between consecutive reversals of the Earth's magnetic ﬁeld through a non-parametric statistics. The study analyzes whether data in different periods of reversal belong to the same distribution, the distribution type and whether the polarity states are equivalent. This analysis was performed for periods from 0 to 40 Ma, 40 to 80 Ma and 120 to 160 Ma. It was found that the data from the three periods show identical statistical characteristics which leads to the symmetry between the states of polarity and to a distribution compatible with a power law, which shows the possibility of a critical phenomenon acting on the geodynamo. The fact that the data obey a power law distribution prompted a comparison with synthetic data generated using two models based on criticality of reversals (one of them self-organized). These simple models reproduce some features of reversals as its temporal evolution and distribution of polarity intervals, and show a similarity with paleomagnetic data.

abstract={In this paper, nine beads from excavations in the Valongo Wharf, located in the harbor area of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil that were utilized as ornaments by Africans and Afrodescendants during the 19th century were analyzed by Raman and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy. All samples in the analysis showed Raman spectra with two bands of maximum intensity around 1000 and 500cm−1 related to the maximum stretching ($\nu$max) and bending mode ($\delta$), respectively, of the tetrahedral network of the SiO4 present in the glass matrix. However, there is variation in the intensity and position of the bands that are directly associated with the burning process and the raw material utilized in the manufacture of the beads. Based on the polymerization index (Ip=A500/AU000), it is possible to relate these two parameters. By establishing a correlation among the Ip and the $\nu$max band, the beads were classified into groups. The results reveal that the beads' base paste exhibits differences, allowing their classification into groups according to the manufacturing process. Based on the combination of the elemental characterization and Raman spectroscopy results, it was also possible to conclude that European and Asian countries are the possible origins of the beads.},

The history of these coins, dated between the end of the 17th century and the beginning of the 19th century, had a great influence on the immigration of the Portuguese Prince Regent D. Jo{\~a}o to Brazil, who arrived in 1808. Bearing in mind the need to expand the timid Brazilian monetary system, the Portuguese crown decided to collect Spanish silver pesos of 8 reales, recoined with a value of 960 r{\'e}is. The recoinage procedure was carried out using a stamp; therefore, in many cases, it is possible to check the base currency. In this work, were investigated 17 samples of 960 r{\'e}is coins by XRF, in which the base coin was 8 reales manufactured with raw materials from Mexican mines. In addition to characterizing the elemental composition of the coins, the XRF data were evaluated using multivariate statistical method of Robust Principal Component Analysis (ROBPCA), which was used to classify the coins based on their elemental composition. However, with XRF, elementary information is obtained for a depth of only a few micrometers. One of the essential issues in Ag--Cu metal alloys is the Ag enrichment, which can cause changes to the elemental composition of the surface. Therefore, initially, a study was carried out to verify whether the surface compositions of the coins were altered by the Ag enrichment.},

abstract={We put forward an enantioselective method for chiral nanoparticles using optical tweezers. We demonstrate that the optical trapping force in a typical, realistic optical tweezing setup with circularly-polarized trapping beams is sensitive to the chirality of core--shell nanoparticles, allowing for efficient enantioselection. It turns out that the handedness of the trapped particles can be selected by choosing the appropriate circular polarization of the trapping beam. The chirality of each individual trapped nanoparticle can be characterized by measuring the rotation of the equilibrium position under the effect of a transverse Stokes drag force. We show that the chirality of the shell gives rise to an additional twist, leading to a strong enhancement of the optical torque driving the rotation. Both methods are shown to be robust against variations of size and material parameters, demonstrating that they are particularly useful in (but not restricted to) several situations of practical interest in chiral plasmonics, where enantioselection and characterization of single chiral nanoparticles, each and every one with its unique handedness and optical properties, are in order. In particular, our method could be employed to unveil the chiral response arising from disorder in individual plasmonic raspberries, synthesized by close-packing a large number of metallic nanospheres around a dielectric core.},

Our method is based on the direct observation of the particle equilibrium position under the effect of a transverse Stokes drag force, and its rotation around the optical axis by the mechanical effect of the optical torque. We find overall agreement with theory, with no fitting, provided that astigmatism, which is characterized separately, is included in the theoretical description. Our work opens the way for characterization of the trapping parameters, such as the microsphere complex refractive index and the astigmatism of the optical system, from measurements of the microsphere rotation angle.},

To calculate the doses in the tissues and organs of the head, the Monte Carlo N-Particle radiation transport code is used. The results suggest the possibility of using a beam of 6 cm in diameter for the treatment of tumours in the frontal lobe and parietal regions. With a beam of 10 cm in diameter, we could treat tumours located in the frontal lobe, parietal lobe and thalamus. The work also shows that the contribution of the secondary components (gamma rays, fast and thermal neutrons) in the calculation of the total dose can result in up to 15{\%} of the dose in the tumour tissue, 68{\%} of the dose in the healthy brain tissue and 87{\%} of the dose in the non-cephalic regions.},

abstract={We demonstrate that achieving zero backward scattering (ZBS), i.e., the first Kerker condition, allows for optical tweezing of high-index microspheres, which cannot be trapped using standard techniques. For this purpose, we propose an alternative material platform based on composite metamaterials. By tuning the volume filling fraction of inclusions and the microsphere radius, stable trapping can be achieved provided that ZBS is combined with the condition for destructive interference between the fields reflected at the external and internal interfaces of the microsphere when located at the focal point. By using the Mie-Debye-spherical aberration theory, we also show that the ZBS condition is even more useful in realistic, standard optical tweezer setups, in which spherical aberration is unavoidable due to refraction at the interface between the glass slide and the water-filled sample. Altogether, our findings not only pave the way for possible new trapping designs and applications but also unveil the role of backscattering in the physics of optical tweezers.},

abstract={Optical-tweezers experiments in molecular and cell biology often take place near the surface of the microscope slide that defines the bottom of the sample chamber. There, as elsewhere, force measurements require force-calibrated tweezers. In bulk, one can calculate the tweezers force from first principles, as recently demonstrated. Near the surface of the microscope slide, this absolute calibration method fails because it does not account for reverberations from the slide of the laser beam scattered by the trapped microsphere. Nor does it account for evanescent waves arising from total internal reflection of wide-angle components of the strongly focused beam. In the present work we account for both of these phenomena. We employ Weyl's angular spectrum representation of spherical waves in terms of real and complex rays and derive a fast-converging recursive series of multiple reflections that describes the reverberations, including also evanescent waves. Numerical simulations for typical setup parameters evaluate these effects on the optical force and trap stiffness, with emphasis on axial trapping. Results are in good agreement with available experimental data. Thus, absolute calibration now applies to all situations encountered in practice.},

abstract={Optical tweezers are highly versatile laser traps for neutral microparticles, with fundamental applications in physics and in single molecule cell biology. Force measurements are performed by converting the stiffness response to displacement of trapped transparent microspheres, employed as force transducers. Usually, calibration is indirect, by comparison with fluid drag forces. This can lead to discrepancies by sizable factors. Progress achieved in a program aiming at absolute calibration, conducted over the past 15 years, is briefly reviewed. Here we overcome its last major obstacle, a theoretical overestimation of the peak stiffness, within the most employed range for applications, and we perform experimental validation. The discrepancy is traced to the effect of primary aberrations of the optical system, which are now included in the theory. All required experimental parameters are readily accessible. Astigmatism, the dominant effect, is measured by analyzing reflected images of the focused laser spot, adapting frequently employed video microscopy techniques. Combined with interface spherical aberration, it reveals a previously unknown window of instability for trapping. Comparison with experimental data leads to an overall agreement within error bars, with no fitting, for a broad range of microsphere radii, from the Rayleigh regime to the ray optics one, for different polarizations and trapping heights, including all commonly employed parameter domains. Besides signaling full first-principles theoretical understanding of optical tweezers operation, the results may lead to improved instrument design and control over experiments, as well as to an extended domain of applicability, allowing reliable force measurements, in principle, from femtonewtons to nanonewtons.},

abstract={The Monte Carlo method is a powerful tool for investigating the characteristics of x-ray beams in diagnostic radiology. An accurate CT MC simulation typically requires a detailed description of the scanner under investigation, including specifications of the photon energy spectrum, the bowtie and inherent filtration design, and the geometry of the scanner (focal spot to isocenter distance, fan angle). Modern CT dosimetry is substantially informed by data produced using Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques. In order to achieve desired levels of accuracy, methods require a good model of the x-ray spectrum used. It has been shown that x-ray spectrum modeling can produce adequate spectra if both the tube potential and the HVL of the x-ray beam are known [1]. Therefore, for accurate CT dosimetry, characterization of the HVL of the CT scanner is necessary. In this work the Phillps® provided the spectrum of Brilliance 64 scanner. The purpose of this work is evaluating all data send by the manufacturer in the way to obtain a spectrum that can be used in Monte Carlo simulations to estimate organ dose or other dosimetric quantities. The EGSnrc MC code was used to evaluate the HVL obtained with the spectrum provided by the manufacturer. The cavity code was used for these simulations and variance reduction techniques were used. The HVL of our MC models were benchmarked against experimental data. The authors found that the HVL of the MC simulations agreed well with the manufacturer-specified data within 1--5{\%} on average for the scanner. This study may be useful to establish a patient-specific dosimetry for the Phillips Brilliance 64 CT systems.},

abstract={The pigments characterization in artwork and cultural heritage is important since it allows to reveal many information like the period characteristics in which the object was made, its provenance and its manufacturing technique. Furthermore, it can support in the identification of forgeries and in the evaluation of conservation and restoration interventions. In this work, it was used XRF, $\mu$XRF, XRD and Raman spectroscopy techniques in the characterization of a statuette of the ``Nossa Senhora da Concei{\c{c}}{\~a}o Aparecida''. The X-ray fluorescence analysis were performed in 66 points distributed throughout the piece, like in the wood structure, in the ground layer and on the pigment layer. In addition, elemental mapping was performed using the X-ray micro fluorescence ($\mu$XRF) technique in a small fragment, containing both the pigment and the ground layer. The X-ray diffraction analyzes were performed on the ground layer material and the Raman spectroscopy was performed in order to improve the evaluation of the data and assist in the characterization of the ground and the pigment layers. The results show that the major elements in the pigment were Fe and Mn, indicating that it's probably the Burnt Sienna pigment. The XRD and Raman analysis show that the substrate layer was made by calcium carbonate (calcite) and a binder material (probably rabbit glue).},
